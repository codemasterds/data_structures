we use the mathematical functions to determine the Big- O notation.

we can use the graph between time and input size to determine the equation and get what is the big-o notation for that program. 

For Big-O notation we have to keep the fastest growing term and drop the constants.

Big-O notation is generally to used in the worst case senario. For example we complete the search in the first iteration itself!
